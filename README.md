# Human-Clock-Chrome-Extension
This is an unofficial project. I am in no way affiliated with the Human Clock project.

Get images from the [Human Clock project](https://www.humanclock.com/) for your current time when you open a new tab. Choose between a random image, the first one in the list and a responsive grid of *all* images for that time! You can also toggle the captions on/off.
# Demo

I was inspired to create this extension after seeing the official project on [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25411997). I realized right away that I couldn't be the only one to want this as a new tab replacement for their web browser :)
