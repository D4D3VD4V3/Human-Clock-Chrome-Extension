# Human-Clock-Chrome-Extension
This is an unofficial project. I am in no way affiliated with the Human Clock project.

Get images from the [Human Clock project](https://www.humanclock.com/) for your current time when you open a new tab. Choose between a random image, the first one in the list and, a responsive grid of *all* images for that time! You can also toggle the captions on/off. There's also a dark background option for those those who prefer dark mode.
# Demo

This extension was inspired by the official project on [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25411997). I realized right away that I couldn't be the only one to want this as a new tab replacement for their web browser :)

# Installation
1. Download/clone this repo.
2. Open the Extension Management page by navigating to chrome://extensions The Extension Management page can also be opened by clicking on the Chrome menu, hovering over More Tools then selecting Extensions.
3. Enable Developer Mode by clicking the toggle switch next to Developer mode.
4. Click the LOAD UNPACKED button and select the extension directory.
5. Click on the little jigsaw icon to the right of the URL bar to find the icon for the extension where you can change the settings.
